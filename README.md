# Lab 4 â€“ String Manipulation
## What the Script Does
### Exercise 1
This script takes a name and prints it out so that the first and fourth letters are capitalized
### Exercise 2
This script takes information scraped from a url and manipulates the string to clean up the output to say:
> Tonight: Clear, Low: 55 F
>
> Thursday: Sunny then Chance Showers, High: 77 F
> 
> Friday: Sunny, High: 73 F
> 
> Saturday: Mostly Sunny, High: 77 F
> 
> Sunday: Mostly Sunny, High: 71 F
### Exercise 3
This script takes a url to google maps and manipulates the string url to extract the latitude and longitude from the link
## Major Errors
I found this assignment challenging. The first assignment it took me a long time to get the for loop to work with the iteration. This was an indent issue.
The second and third exercise I didn't really understand what we were supposed to do, so it took me a while to figure out what the lab was asking me. On the seond assignment I spent a long time trying to get the script to work using the isupper and islower functions to create spaces where there was a lower case followed by an upper case and then realized that was probably too complicated. The third assignment, it took me a long time to get the script to break up the list. 
## Fixing those Errors
The first two assignment was a lot of trial and error and referring back to the textbook and code along colab notebooks. The third exercise I found this link helpful:https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/python/python-string-split/#:~:text=called%20split().-,Python%20Split%20function,will%20be%20used%20by%20default.
